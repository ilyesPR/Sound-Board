Note : extract the soundBoard.zip file and make sure the soundBoard file is withtin the same parent file as the exe.
I put the C file if anyone wants to tinker or add any voice effects of his own, just change the file path to whatever meets your needs.

Make sure to disable Caps Lock when using it because C is case sensitive.

To compile using MinGW, you will need to use the `-lwinmm` flag.
On Code::Blocks, you can find compiler flags in : Settings-->Complier..-->Linker Settings-->Other linker options.
