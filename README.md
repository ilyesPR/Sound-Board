Note : extract the soundBoard.zip file and make sure the soundBoard file is withtin the same parent file as the exe
I put the C file if anyone wants to tinker or add any voice effects of his own, just change the file path to whatever meets your needs.

For anyone using Note::Blocks on windows and using MinGW GCC, if codeblocks launches an error when you compile, go to : Settings-->Complier..-->Linker Settings-->Other linker options--> and write -lwinmm.
